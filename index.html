    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18.10.2024</p>

    <p><em>Car Driving Sim</em> ("the game") is developed and operated by Transylvanian Tales ("we", "us", "our"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle personal data in relation to your use of the game.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p style = "margin-bottom: 0px">We want to make it clear that the game does not collect any personal or non-personal data from its users. This includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
    <ul style = "margin-top: 0px">
        <li>No personal information such as names, addresses, emails, or phone numbers is collected directly by us.</li>
        <li>The game uses Unity Ads, which may collect device information (such as device identifiers, IP address, and location) for the purpose of delivering personalized or contextual advertisements.</li>
        <li>We do not collect or store any user data ourselves.</li>
        <li>No leaderboards or in-game communication that requires data sharing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since the game does not collect any personal information, it complies with regulations protecting children’s privacy, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The game is safe for all ages and does not require any parental consent or intervention for data collection because there is no data collection.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The game uses <strong>Unity Ads</strong> to display in-game advertisements. Unity Ads is a third-party service provided by Unity Technologies. Unity Ads may collect data such as device identifiers, IP addresses, location data, and usage information in order to deliver and improve ad performance and relevance.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>Although the game does not collect personal information, we prioritize the protection of any non-personal data that might incidentally come from usage of the platform (such as error logs). However, as no personal information is collected, there is no specific data stored on our servers related to player identity.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
